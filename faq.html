      <h4>Q: Do you sell pre-owned vehicles?</h4>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        A: Yes. In fact, we exclusively sell used trucks, cars, and SUVs. This
        allows us to focus fully on building our pre-owned inventory.

      <h4>Q: Will I need a down-payment?</h4>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        A: Sometimes, a down-payment isn't needed when financing. However, it
        depends on various factors, such as your credit score, loan amount, and
        more.

      <h4>Q: Do you sell new models?</h4>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        A: Although we have many like-new models with low mileage on them, we do
        not sell any brand-new vehicles. However, many of these vehicles offer
        the modern features, performance, and safety you've been looking for.
